/**
 Exercises 5

Page Redirection and HTTP 404 Status Code
Create a file that expects a URL query parameter ‘action’. If the action is either ‘home’
or ‘bio’, print some content. If the action is one of the two, show the message. If the
action is ‘info’ redirect to ‘bio’. If the action is not set, or is not one of the 3 allowed
actions, display a 404 message with a status code of 404.
See the slides if you need a reminder for how this works.
