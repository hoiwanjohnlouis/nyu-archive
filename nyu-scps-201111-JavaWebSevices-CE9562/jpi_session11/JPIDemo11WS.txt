Attached are the two projects I demoed yesterday. Since the size of the jars are two big I had to remove them from JPIDemo11WS project.

Here is what you have to do:

a)	Import the two projects in your eclipse.
b)	Download apache-cxf-2.5.1 zipped binary.
c)	Unzip.
d)	Copy the content of the ‘lib’ folder of CXF (including the endorsed sub-folder) into JPIDemo11WS projects WebContent\WEB-INF\lib folder.
e)	Start the app
f)	Run the client and you should be in business.
g)
